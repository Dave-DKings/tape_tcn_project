For `PortfolioEnvTAPE`, I will redefine the `step` method with the enhanced debug logging. For `tcn_phase1`, I will read the source file, apply the new TAPE score logging patch (replacing the conditional check to force printing), and re-apply the High Watermark patch (to preserve previous functionality). Finally, I will execute the patched code in the module's namespace.\n","\n"],"id":"51dbcd9f"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1a9c1318","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771262517693,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":70,"user":{"displayName":"David Dussey","userId":"12105630327085320723"}},"outputId":"576f02e0-5c59-452c-b246-e7e1dedc089e"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import inspect\n","from src.environment_tape_rl import PortfolioEnvTAPE, calculate_episode_metrics, calculate_tape_score, logger\n","import src.notebook_helpers.tcn_phase1 as tcn_phase1\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import re\n","\n","# ==============================================================================\n","# 1.

For `PortfolioEnvTAPE`, I will redefine the `step` method with the enhanced debug logging. For `tcn_phase1`, I will read the source file, apply the new TAPE score logging patch (replacing the conditional check to force printing), and re-apply the High Watermark patch (to preserve previous functionality). Finally, I will execute the patched code in the module's namespace.\n","\n"],"id":"941ccf0c"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"e16929e1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771262652222,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"David Dussey","userId":"12105630327085320723"}},"outputId":"2284bccb-93c7-4677-af8e-355fe52b4727"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import inspect\n","from src.environment_tape_rl import PortfolioEnvTAPE, calculate_episode_metrics, calculate_tape_score, logger\n","import src.notebook_helpers.tcn_phase1 as tcn_phase1\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import re\n","\n","# ==============================================================================\n","# 1.

This was necessary to diagnose why TAPE scores might be returning `None` or 0.0 during training.\n","\n","**Q: How was the missing logging addressed without modifying files on disk permanently?**\n","A: The agent used \"monkey patching\" (runtime code modification). It read the source code of the target modules, injected specific logging statements and logic handling (e.g., forcing prints even if variables are `None`), and then executed this modified code in the active memory space using Python's `exec()` function.\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","*   **Source Code Deficiencies:** Inspection of `PortfolioEnvTAPE.step` revealed it lacked the granular logging requested in `/content/debug_tape_score_prompt.md` (specifically for reward systems and metric calculations).\n","*   **Logic Suppression in Runner:** The experiment runner `src.notebook_helpers.tcn_phase1` contained a conditional check (`if tape_score is not None:`) that silently skipped logging if the score was missing, hindering debugging.\n","*   **Patch Verification Success:**\n","    *   The patch for `PortfolioEnvTAPE.step` was successfully verified in memory; `inspect.getsource` confirmed the presence of the injected marker `\"DEBUG: Terminating with reward_system\"`.\n","    *   The `tcn_phase1` patch was successfully applied, incorporating both the \"High Watermark\" feature (saving best models) and the fix to force TAPE score logging.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   **System Readiness:** The environment is now fully patched with extensive debug instrumentation. Any subsequent training runs in this session will output the detailed TAPE metric logs required for diagnosis.\n","*   **Next Step:** Proceed immediately to run the training experiment (`run_experiment6_tape`).
